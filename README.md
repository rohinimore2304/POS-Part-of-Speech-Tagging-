# Steps for POS Tagging Task

# 1. Text Preprocessing
Before performing POS tagging, we first tokenize the input text into individual words. The nltk library provides a tokenizer to break the text into words or sentences.

import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

text = "ChatGPT is an AI language model."
tokens = word_tokenize(text)

# 2. POS Tagging
   
Once we have the tokenized words, we can apply the POS tagging function from the nltk library. The function assigns each token with a tag that indicates its grammatical category.

nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
tagged_tokens = nltk.pos_tag(tokens)
print(tagged_tokens)
The output will be a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a word and its corresponding POS tag:


[('Chatbot', 'NNP'), ('is', 'VBZ'), ('an', 'DT'), ('AI', 'NNP'), ('language', 'NN'), ('model', 'NN')]
NNP stands for proper noun.

VBZ is the verb, 3rd person singular present.

DT is a determiner.

# 3. POS Tagging with Pre-trained Models
   
The nltk library provides a pre-trained model (averaged_perceptron_tagger) that can predict the POS tags based on the context of the word in a sentence. This model can tag a wide range of POS categories (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.).

from nltk import pos_tag, word_tokenize
nltk.download('punkt')
text = "The cat sat on the mat."
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
tagged_tokens = pos_tag(tokens)
print(tagged_tokens)

# 4. Tagging in Real-World Use Cases
   
POS tagging is useful in many applications, such as:

Parsing: Understanding sentence structure.

Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying entities like names, locations, etc.

Text-to-Speech (TTS): Pronunciation guides depend on the POS of a word.

# 5. Evaluating POS Tagging Accuracy

You can compare the POS tags assigned by the model to a manually labeled dataset for accuracy. For more advanced tasks, you can use annotated datasets like the Penn Treebank for evaluating the performance of your POS tagging model.
